# Project Alibaba Cloud RAM

  

Welcome to the digital underbelly of the future, where Terraform meets cyberpunk. This isn't just coding; it's coding with attitude, in a world where the neon lights flicker and the console is your gateway to the unknown.

## What's This Madness?

  

Imagine a terraform IAM project that decided to go on a neon-lit joyride through a dystopian future to add an Alibaba Cloud Ram user for John Menerick. That's me. I code with one hand on the keyboard and the other holding a digital katana.

# Project LastPass

  

Welcome to the digital underbelly of the future, where Python Lastpass API user creation meets cyberpunk. This isn't just coding; it's coding with attitude, in a world where the neon lights flicker and the console is your gateway to the unknown.

## What's This Madness?

  

Imagine a Python Lastpass API user creation project that decided to go on a neon-lit joyride through a dystopian future. That's us. We code with one hand on the keyboard and the other holding a digital katana.

  

## Installation: Plugging into the Matrix

  

 `git clone https://github.com/w8mej/Credential.git`

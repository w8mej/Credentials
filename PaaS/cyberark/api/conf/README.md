## CyberArk - "Code Runner's Dystopia"

**Version**: 4.2.1 - "Neuromancer's Cousin"

### Welcome to the Cyber Config Chamber, Code Warrior!

In the murky depths of this folder lies the heart of our Python project – a place where bits meet bytes in a digital tango.

---

### Config Files: The DNA of the Digital Beast

In this cryptic chamber, you'll find the configuration files – the sacred scripts that dictate how our cybernetic serpent slithers through the neon-lit streets of the codebase.

---

### Setup: Tune Your Cyberdeck

1. **Choose Your Config**: `config.ini`, `settings.json`, or `cyberprefs.cyb` – pick your poison.
2. **Customize Your Reality**: Edit the config file with your favorite neon-colored text editor.
3. **Unleash the Beast**: Save the file and watch as your codebase transforms before your very eyes.

---

### Features: Your Toolkit in the Shadows

- **Virtual Environment Config**: Tailor your digital sandbox. No sand included.
- **Database Settings**: Tweak these to chat with your SQL street gangs.
- **Debug Options**: Flip the switch and see the Matrix – or at least your bugs.

---

### Usage: Configuring with Style

```json
{
  "database": "neo_tokyo_db",
  "debug": true,
  "max_connections": 100,
  "use_cyber_ai": false
}
```

### Warning: Tread Carefully

Config files are like digital landmines. One wrong step and BOOM – your project is in the ether. Always backup before tweaking!

### Help: In Case of a Digital Apocalypse

- **Docs**: Even a lone wolf needs a map. Our documentation is your cyber compass.

### License: The Code of the Streets

This config setup is under the same MIT License as the rest of the project. Use it well, use it wisely.

**Note**: Changing settings while sipping a cup of Club-Mate is recommended but not required.
